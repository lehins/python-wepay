Features
--------

* Make API calls in a very natural pythonic way, ex:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> api = WePay(production=False, access_token='STAGE_243...')
    >>> response = api.credit_card.create(client_id, cc_number, ..., original_ip='127...')
    >>> api.credit_card.authorize(client_id, client_secret, response['credit_card_id'])

* Validation of all required and optional parameters to each one of the calls.
* Very easy construction of batch calls, simply by passing ``batch_mode=True`` to
  a call, ex:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> calls = []
    >>> calls.append(api.credit_card.authorize(client_id, client_secret, response['credit_card_id'],
    ...              batch_mode=True, batch_reference_id='ref_id_1234'))
    >>> # append more calls ...
    >>> response = api.batch.create(client_id, client_secret, calls)


About
-----

This package started as a part of `Django WePay Application
<https://github.com/lehins/django-wepay>`_, but I soon realized it could be
useful to other developers in Python community that do not use `Django
<https://djangoproject.com>`_. Originally it meant to be an extension of an
official `Python WePay SDK <https://github.com/wepay/Python-SDK>`_, but instead
it became a replacement with full compatibilty with official WePay version.

Status
------

Production.

* Registered Application with WePay `production <https://wepay.com>`_ site or
